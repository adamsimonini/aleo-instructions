# 🦁 Aleo Instructions - Your Leo Programming Cheat Sheet

> **Because sometimes you just need a quick reference when building the future of privacy-first blockchain! 🚀**

## What's This All About?

Welcome to your personal Aleo development survival kit! This is a collection of quick references, commands, and examples that I've gathered while diving into the world of Aleo and Leo programming. Think of it as your "I forgot how to do that thing" folder. 😅

## 📁 What's Inside?

### 🛠️ `docs.md` - The Command Center
Your go-to guide for:
- Setting up a local Aleo network (because testing on mainnet is expensive!)
- Deploying your Leo programs
- Executing functions on your local network
- Building your projects

### 🎯 `leo.md` - Leo CLI Quick Reference
Quick links to Leo CLI documentation because who has time to remember all those commands?

### 📝 `types.md` - The Type System Bible
A comprehensive guide to Aleo's type system including:
- **Primitive types**: `field`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `bool`
- **Composite types**: Arrays, Records, Structs, Constants
- **Privacy features**: Understanding `.private` fields and zero-knowledge proofs

## 🎯 Perfect For...

- **Aleo developers** who need a quick reference
- **Leo programmers** who forget syntax (we've all been there!)
- **Blockchain enthusiasts** exploring privacy-first development
- **Anyone** who wants to avoid digging through docs every 5 minutes

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo** (or just copy the files you need)
2. **Bookmark the files** in your browser
3. **Keep them handy** when coding
4. **Profit!** 💰

## 🤝 Contributing

Found something missing? Made a mistake? Want to add more examples?

Feel free to:
- Add more examples
- Fix typos
- Include more commands
- Share your own tips and tricks

## 🎉 Why This Exists

Let's be honest - Aleo's documentation is great, but sometimes you just need that one specific example or command without scrolling through pages of docs. This is my attempt to solve that problem for myself (and hopefully you too!).

**Happy coding! 🦁✨**

*Remember: In the world of zero-knowledge proofs, the only thing that should be private is your data, not your development knowledge!*
